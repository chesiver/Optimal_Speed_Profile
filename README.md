# Optimal_Speed_Profile
Optimal Speed profile along a given path

Given a fixed path, connected by a bunch of points, and there is a maximum acceleration limit for the moving ball.

We are curious about how to calculate the best speed profile, which means the one that makes the total time minimum for the moving ball
by one pass along the given path.

An analytical solution is very difficult, since the complexity and variation of the path shape. We can use forward and backword scheme 
to calculate the maximum speed of each point.
